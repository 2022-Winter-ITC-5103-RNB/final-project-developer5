            <h2>Ahmedabad!</h2>
            <p>Ahmedabad or Amdavad as Gujaratis love to call it, is a city that paints a pretty picture of fun, frolic,
                colours of the chaniya cholis and the taste of gathiyas and undhiyu. It is the first in the world to be
                declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO. Ahmedabad has undergone continuous change since the time it
                was conceptualised and founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah. But, all through these years, something that has
                stayed constant is the love of the city for celebrating life, and preserving its heritage through its
                architectural wonders. These wonders are now the pride of the city and are some of the top tourist
                attractions of Gujarat. Apart from these, there are several parks and water tanks in the city that are
                worthy of a visit.

        <h3>Famous Places to Visit</h3>
        <h3>1. Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary</h3>
        <section class="place">

            <div class="left">
                <p>This 121-sq-km sanctuary, 60km southwest of Ahmedabad, protects Nalsarovar Lake, iron-flat plains and
                    wetlands. This is the largest wetland sanctuary in the state and one of the biggest in the country
                    as well. The sanctuary has flocks of indigenous and migratory birds, with as many as 250 species
                    passing through in the winters. Ducks, geese, eagles, spoonbills, cranes, pelicans and flamingos are
                    best seen at daybreak and dusk. Wild asses and black bucks are also commonly seen in the lush
                    region. There is an interpretation centre here which offers details on birds and the habitat,
                    especially flamingos, pelicans, egrets, herons, ducks, cormorants and cranes. Nalsarovar is a
                    proposed Ramsar Convention site, which is a list of wetlands of international importance.</p>

        <h3>2.Adalaj Ni Valv</h3>
        <section class="place">

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>The flamboyant 15th-century stepwell, has lost only little of its grandeur over the last few
                    centuries. Till date, the intricate carvings on the pillars that support the five storeys are mostly
                    intact; the beams work as pit stops for pigeons flying in and out and the structure still leaves
                    jaws dropped for swarms of people. The step-well represents the Indo-Islamic fusion architecture
                    that percolated through the many stepwells of the period. There are some fascinating features of the
                    vav that make this an important emblem of superior architecture. The opening in the ceilings above
                    the landing allows light and air to enter the octagonal well, but direct sunlight never touches the
                    steps except at noon. It is said that the temperature inside the well is six degrees cooler than
                    outside. The stepwell has three entrances. The stairs lead to an underground storey, which has an
                    octagonal opening on top. The walls are covered in ornamental carvings with mythological and village
                    scenes. Some of them include Ami khumbor (a pot that contains the water of life) and the Kalp
                    vriksha (a tree of life) carved out of a single slab of stone. There is a belief that the small
                    frieze of Navagraha (nine-planets) towards the edge of the well protects the monument from bad
                    omens.</p>

        <h3>3.Polo Forest</h3>
        <section class="place">
            <div class="left">
                <p>Tucked away in a forest, there are secrets to be revealed. An ancient city, a gateway to Rajasthan. A
                    hiding place for rulers, concealed from enemies, citizens, angry wives, even from the sun, tucked
                    between sacred hills on the east and west. And the mystery of abandonment, decay. Ancient temples,
                    some still performing their pujas deep within this dense jungle, is itself the larger temple, and
                    the trees themselves are the Gods.
                    Adivasi settlements, their lives rooted in their connection to the forest, from whom you might learn
                    to listen to the deep hum of the world that envelops these scattered whispers of human
                    constructions.
                    Come. Listen. Learn. Know your Self. You may return to your homes, your cities, your roads, but the
                    forest will never leave you.</p>
