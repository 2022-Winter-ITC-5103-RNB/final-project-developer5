            <h2>Maharashtra</h2>
            <p><strong>Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra, an Indian state. With a population of almost 2 crore,
                    Mumbai is India's second-most populous metropolis after Delhi and the world's eighth-most
                    populous city, according to the United Nations. According to the 2011 Indian government
                    population census, Mumbai was India's most populated city, with a population of 1.25 crore
                    living in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. With a population of over 2.3 crore,
                    Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the world's sixth most populated
                    metropolitan area. Mumbai is located on India's west coast, on the Konkan coast, and boasts a
                    deep natural harbour. Mumbai was the most populous city in India in 2008.</strong></p>

            <h2>Major Tourist Attractions</h2>
            <h3>Gateway of India</h3>
            <img src="/Images/gateway.jpg" alt="gateway">
            <div class="gateway">
                <p><strong>The Gateway of India, which stands proudly on the banks of the Arabian Sea in the Apollo
                        Bunder
                        waterfront district, is one of Mumbai's most popular and revered sights. The 26-meter basalt
                        archway
                        was created as a welcome gesture for King George V and Queen Mary when they visited British
                        India in
                        1911. It combines the architectural forms of Roman triumphal arches with traditional Hindu and
                        Muslim patterns. Ironically, the last British troops left India via this archway in 1948, when
                        the
                        country achieved independence from the United Kingdom.<br></strong></p>
                <p><strong>The Gateway of India is now one of Mumbai's most popular gathering locations for both
                        tourists
                        and locals. From the five jetties that flank the arch, you can watch yachts and ferries set
                        sail.
                        Street food sellers sell the famed bhelpuri (a crispy, salty delicacy composed of puffed rice
                        and
                        drenched with tamarind sauce). Alternatively, you may simply spend an hour or two
                        people-watching at
                        this bustling attraction.</strong></p>

            <div class="bollywood">
                <p><strong>Since the 1930s, when the Bombay Talkies movie studio was created in the city, Bollywood,
                        India's largest film industry, has had a stronghold in Mumbai. Every year, Bollywood produces
                        over to 1,000 films, ranging from historical epics to curry westerns to courtesan
                        movies.<br></strong></p>
                <p><strong>On a full-day private Bollywood tour, you can get a behind-the-scenes glimpse at this
                        blockbuster machine. Tourists will visit two Bollywood film studios, pose for photos with the
                        stars (subject to scheduling availability), watch Bollywood dancing and learn some choreography,
                        and drive through the luxury neighbourhood where the top Bollywood actors and actresses live on
                        this excursion.</strong></p>

            <h3>Bandra-Worli Sea Link</h3>
            <img src="/Images/sea-lik.jpg" alt="sea-link">
            <div class="sea-link">
                <p><strong>The Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a cable-stayed bridge, is one of Mumbai's most iconic sights. The
                        eight-lane bridge, which opened in 2009, connects the central business area with the western
                        suburbs across the open sea, providing much-needed relief from the Mahim Causeway's congestion.
                        It has become Mumbai's counterpart of the Brooklyn Bridge or the Opera House in New
                        York.<br></strong></p>
                <p><strong>Head to the Bandra Fort, a historic watchtower built by the Portuguese in 1640, for the best
                        views of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. It's also worthwhile to drive across the bridge. The
                        crashing water may be seen on both sides of the bridge during the day. Watch the bridge light up
                        with stunning colours at night.</strong></p>
