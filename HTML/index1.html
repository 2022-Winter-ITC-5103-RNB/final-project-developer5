                        The etchings and prehistoric line drawings are a testament to the culture and lives of those who lived in the caves years ago.The Edakkal cave paintings are remarkable in their sheer scale and complexity, but their origins are shrouded in mystery. Ever since their discovery in 1895, they have been a source of awe and wonder for tourists and historians alike.The engravings are not the only attractions at Edakkal. The Muniyaras, or ancient burial sites that have been discovered in these hills have yielded a rich collection of ancient earthenware and pottery. Most of the artifacts discovered here are now housed in the Wayanad Heritage Museum.
